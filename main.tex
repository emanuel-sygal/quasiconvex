Let $f_c: z\mapsto z^2 + c$ be a quadratic polynomial. Its {\em filled Julia set} consists of the points in the complex plane with bounded orbit
under iteration by $f_c$:
$$
\mathcal K_c = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : \sup_{n \ge 0} f_c^{\circ n}(z) < \infty \}.
$$
Its boundary $\mathcal J_c = \partial \mathcal K(f_c)$ is known as the {\em Julia set}, and its complement $\Exterior(\mathcal{J}_c) = \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathcal K(f_c)$ forms the {\em attracting basin of infinity}. 

The set $\mathcal K_c$ is compact, and each\
  of the three sets
$\mathcal J_c, \mathcal K_c$ and $\Exterior(\mathcal{J}_c)$ are both forward and backward invariant under the dynamics of $f$.
 
The {\em main cardioid}
$$
\heartsuit = \bigl  \{c \in \mathbb{C}: c = \lambda/2 - \lambda^2/4,\, \lambda \in \mathbb{D} \bigr \}
$$
is the set of parameters $c \in \mathbb{C}$ for which $f_c$ has an attracting fixed point.
When $c \in \heartsuit$, the Julia set $\mathcal J_c$ is a \emph{quasidisk}, the image of a round disk under a quasiconformal map.
This intuitively means that $\mathcal K_c$ has no \enquote{cusps}.

% Parameters $c \in \heartsuit$ are {\em hyperbolic}. Loosely speaking, this means that $\mathcal J_c$ satisfies the principle of the conformal elevator: 
% up to bounded distortion, a small piece of $\mathcal J_c$ looks like a large piece $\mathcal J_c$.

In this work we take $c=1/4$, which lies on the boundary of $\heartsuit$. 
The filled Julia set $\mathcal K_{1/4}$, also called the \emph{Cauliflower}, 
is a Jordan domain with an inward-pointing cusp at the point $p=1/2$. According to a theorem of Carleson, Jones and Yoccoz \cite[Theorem 6.1]{carleson_julia_1994}, 
the Cauliflower is a \emph{John domain}, a condition which rules out \enquote{outward-pointing cusps}. 
Formally, a domain $\Omega$ is John if there exists a \enquote{center} point 
$z_0 \in \Omega$ that can be connected 
to any other point $z_1\in \Omega$ by a curve $\gamma$ which stays away from the boundary:
\begin{equation}
	\dist(z, \partial \Omega) \gtrsim |z_1-z|
\end{equation} for all $z\in \gamma$.
 See \cref{fig:julia_sets}.

A domain $\Omega\subseteq\C$ is called \textbf{quasiconvex} 
if its intrinsic metric is comparable to the ambient Euclidean metric. 
Explicitly, this means that there exists a constant $A\geq1$ such that every two points $z_{1},z_{2}\in\Omega$
 are connected by a rectifiable path $\gamma_{z_1,z_2}:\left[0,1\right]\to\Omega$ which satisfies
\begin{equation}
\Length(\gamma_{z_1,z_2})\leq A\cdot\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|.	
\end{equation}

We refer to such a family of paths $\gamma_{z_1,z_2}$ as \emph{quasiconvexity certificates} for $\Omega$.

If $\Omega$ is a quasiconvex Jordan domain, then its complement has a John interior; see \cite[Corollary 3.4]{hakobyan_euclidean_2008} for a proof.
In this work, we strengthen the result of \cite[Theorem 6.1]{carleson_julia_1994} by showing:

\begin{theorem}
The exterior of the Cauliflower is quasiconvex.
\end{theorem}

\input{figures/plot_julia_sets.tex}

%One motivation to study quasiconvexity stems from its connection with the John property:

Our result also has a function-theoretic interpretation. 
For a planar domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R ^2$,
the \emph{Sobolev space} $W^{1,1}(\Omega)$ 
 is the set of functions $u \in L^1(\Omega)$ for which 
 the distributional derivatives $\partial_1 u, \partial_2 u$ exist and are in $L^1(\Omega)$.
We call $\Omega$ a 
\emph{$\textit{W}^\textit{\;1,1}$ extension domain}
 if every 
$u \in W^{1,1}(\Omega)$ extends to a function
in $W^{1,1}(\mathbb{C})$.
In \cite[Equation (1.1) and Theorem 1.4]{strong_bv_extension_2022}, 
it is shown that a bounded simply connected domain
is a $W^{1,1}$ extension domain if and only if its complement is quasiconvex.
Thus our result can be rephrased as follows:

% Or as a consequence of \cite[Theorem 1.1]{koskela_geometric_2010} and \cite[Theorem 1.4]{strong_bv_extension_2022}, we have:

 \begin{theorem}
 The Cauliflower is a $W^{1,1}$ extension domain.
 \end{theorem}
 
\subsection{Sketch of the argument}
To show that a Jordan domain $\Omega$ is quasiconvex, it is enough to find certificates for points $z_{1},z_{2}$ that lie
on the boundary curve $\partial\Omega$. For a proof, see \cite[Corollary F]{hakobyan_euclidean_2008}.

We show quasiconvexity by an explicit construction of certificates connecting any given pair of points on the Julia set.
We first build the certificates in the exterior unit disk $\mathbb D ^*$, 
then we transport them to the exterior of the Cauliflower by the Riemann map $\psi: \mathbb D ^* \to \Exterior(\mathcal J_{1 / 4})$, 
which conjugates $f_0$ with $f_{1/4}$.

To retain control of the certificates after applying $\psi$, 
we build the certificates of $\mathbb D^*$ in a manner invariant under the map $f_0: z\mapsto z^2$.
This translates after applying $\psi$ to an invariance under $f_{1/4}$,
which allows us to employ a parabolic variant of the principle of the conformal elevator.

To facilitate the reading, we first demonstrate the proof in the hyperbolic case of maps $f_c(z)=z^2+c$ where 
$c\in \heartsuit)$, in which the usual conformal elevator applies, 
and we subsequently treat the parabolic case of $c=\frac{1}{4}$.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{The hyperbolic metric}
Even though quasiconvexity is defined using the Euclidean metric, 
the arguments will involve the hyperbolic metric, which is better-behaved in our setting.

\begin{theorem}
	The hyperbolic metric
	\begin{equation} \label{thm: hyp-metric-in-disk}
		\rho = \frac {2|dz|}{1-|z|^2}
	\end{equation}
	is the unique Riemannian metric on the unit disk $\mathbb D$, up to multiplication
	by a positive constant, which is invariant under conformal automorphisms.
\end{theorem}

This defines the hyperbolic metric on topological balls, by requiring that the Riemann map
will be an isometry. Notice that this metric is locally equivalent to the Euclidean metric.
We will need the hyperbolic metric in more general domains:

\begin{definition}
	A domain $U \subset \mathbb C$ is \emph{hyperbolic} if its 
	universal covering space $\tilde U$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb D$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:criterion-hyperbolic-domain}
	Let $U \subset \mathbb C$ be a domain. If the complement $\mathbb C \setminus U$ has at least two points
	then the domain $U$ is hyperbolic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
	Let $U$ be a hyperbolic domain. We equip $\tilde U \cong \mathbb{D}$ with the hyperbolic metric defined in \cref{thm: hyp-metric-in-disk}.
	The \emph{hyperbolic metric} on $U$ is the unique Riemannian metric for which the projection 
	$\tilde U \to U$ is a local isometry.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[The Schwarz-Pick theorem] \label{thm:Schwarz}
	Let $f:U_1 \to U_2$ be a holomorphic map between two hyperbolic domains $U_1,U_2 \subset \mathbb C$.
	Then $f$ is a hyperbolic contraction, meaning that
	\begin{equation}
		\dist(f(z),f(w)) \leq \dist (z,w)
	\end{equation}
	for all $z,w \in U_1$. If $f$ is not a covering map, then the inequality is strict for all $z \neq w$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof. (\cite{milnor_book}, Theorem 2.11)]
	The classical Schwarz lemma is the case $f:\mathbb D \to \mathbb D$.
	It implies the general case since the projections from the universal coverings 
	are local isometries.
	If $f$ is not a covering map, then the lift of $f$
	to the universal coverings is a strict contraction $\mathbb D \to \mathbb D$, 
	again by the classical case.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	Let $f:U_1\to U_2$ be holomorphic map between hyperbolic domains. The \emph{hyperbolic derivative} of $f$ at the point $z$ 
	is given by
	\begin{equation} \label{def:hyp-derivative}
		\norm {f'(z)}_{\hyp} = 
		\frac{\norm{Df(z)(v)}_{\hyp(U_2)}}
		{\norm{v}_{\hyp(U_1)}},
	\end{equation}
	where $v$ is a nonzero tangent vector at the point $z$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{The Distortion Principle}
We record here for convenience a form of Koebe's distortion principle that will be used repeatedly. 

\begin{definition}
	Every topological annulus $A \subset \hat{\mathbb C}$ is biholomorphic to 
	a unique round annulus of the form $\{ 1<|z|<R \}$. 
	The (conformal) \emph{modulus} of $A$ is the value $\Mod(A) = \frac 1{2\pi} \log R$. 


\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[{Koebe's Distortion Principle, \cite[Theorem 2.9]{mcmullen_1994}}]  \label{Koebe}
	Let $D \subset U $ be topological disks with $\Mod(U \setminus D)  \geq m>0$
	 and let $f$ be a map univalent in $U$,
	then we have the bound 
	\begin{equation}
		\frac {|f(y)-f(z)|}{|y-z|} \asymp_m |f'(x)|
	\end{equation}
	for all $x,y,z \in D$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{The relative distance}

The following notion will be used for showing the existence of a Koebe space, i.e. lower bounding the conformal modulus between two sets.
\begin{definition}
	The \emph{relative distance} between two sets $E,F \subset \mathbb C$ is 
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta(E,F) = \frac{\dist(E,F)}{\min(\diam(E), \diam(F))},	
	\end{equation}
	and $\Delta(E,F) = \infty$ if the denominator vanishes.
	If $\Delta(E,F) \geq \eta$, we say that $E$ and $F$ are 
	\emph{$\eta$-relatively separated.}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm: rel-dist-bounds-modulus}
	Let $E,F \subset \mathbb C$ be compact connected sets.
	If $E,F$ are $\eta$-relatively separated, for some constant $\eta>0$,
	then there exists a topological ball $B$ containing $E$ with a definite modulus inside $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus F$:
	\begin{equation}
		\Mod (\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus (B \cup F)) \gtrsim _\eta 1.
	\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	\textcolor{red}{To-do.} This might be related to "the plane is a Loewner space".
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{koebe-quasiconvexity}
Suppose $\gamma$ is a rectifiable curve which efficiently connects two points $w_1, w_2 \in \mathbb{C}$, i.e.~satisfies $$\Length(\gamma) \le C |w_1 - w_2|$$
for some $C > 0$.
Let $U$ be a connected open set that contains $\gamma$ with $\Mod(U, \gamma) \ge m$, and $\varphi: U \to \mathbb{C}$ is a conformal map.
Then, $\varphi \circ \gamma$ connects the points  $z_1 = \varphi(w_1)$ and $z_2 = \varphi(w_2)$ efficiently:
$$
\Length(\varphi \circ \gamma) \le A |z_1 - z_2|,
$$
where the constant $A > 0$ depends on $C$ and $m$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The assumption implies that for any point $w \in \gamma$, the ball $B(w, 2c|w_1 - w_2|)$ is contained in $U$, for some $c > 0$ depending on $m$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $c < 1/3$. 

Covering $\gamma$ by a uniformly bounded number of balls of radius $c|w_1-w_2|$ and applying Koebe's distortion theorem on each ball shows that
$|\varphi'(p)| \asymp |\varphi'(q)|$ for any two points $p, q \in \gamma$. In particular,
\begin{equation}
\label{upper-bound-rel-distance}
\Length(\varphi \circ \gamma) \asymp |\varphi'(w_1)| \cdot \Length(\gamma) \asymp |\varphi'(w_1)| \cdot |w_1 - w_2|.
\end{equation}

Since the ball $B(w_1, 2c|w_1 - w_2|)$ does not contain $w_2$, Koebe's distortion theorem implies that $z_2 \notin B(z_1, c_2 |\varphi'(w_1)| \cdot |w_1 - w_2|)$ for some $c_2 > 0$. This gives the lower bound
\begin{equation}
\label{lower-bound-rel-distance}
|z_1-z_2| \gtrsim |\varphi'(w_1)| \cdot |w_1 - w_2|.
\end{equation}
Putting (\ref{upper-bound-rel-distance}) and (\ref{lower-bound-rel-distance}) two statements together completes the proof.
\end{proof}

	 
\section{The exterior disk}

We connect any two boundary points $\zeta_1, \zeta_2 \in \partial \mathbb D^*$ by a path in $\mathbb D^*$ in a manner that respects the map 
$f_0: \zeta \mapsto \zeta^2$.
We describe these paths using the metaphor of a passenger who travels by train:

\begin{definition}
\emph{Stations} are the points in $\mathbb D ^*$ of the form 
$$
s_{n,k}=2^{1/2^{n}} \exp\left(2\pi i \cdot \frac{k}{2^{n}}\right),\qquad n\in\N_{0},\quad k\in\left\{ 0,\ldots,2^{n}-1\right\}.
$$ 
These are the iterated preimages of the \emph{central station} $s_{0,0} = 2$ under the map $f_{0}$.
We refer to $n$ as the \emph{generation} of the station $s_{n,k}$. 
The $2^{n}$ stations of generation $n$ are equally spaced on the circle $C_{n}=\left\{ \left|\zeta\right|=2^{1/2^{n}}\right\} $. 
\end{definition}

We next lay two types of \enquote{rail tracks}, which we use to travel between stations.

\begin{definition}
Let $s=s_{n,k}$ be a station.

1. The \emph{peripheral neighbors} of $s$ are the two stations $s_{n,\left(k\pm1\right) (\mathrm{mod}\; 2^{n})}$ adjacent to $s_{n,k}$ on $C_{n}$.

2. The \emph{peripheral track }$\gamma_{s,s'}$ from $s$ to a peripheral neighbor $s'$
is the shorter arc of the circle $C_{n}$ connecting $s$ to $s'$.

3. The \emph{radial successor} of $s$ is $\RadialSuccessor(s)=s_{n+1,2k}$, the unique station of generation $n+1$ on the radial segment $[0,s]$.

4. The \emph{express track} $\gamma_{s,s'}$ from $s$ to its radial successor $s'$ is the radial segment $[s,s']$.
\end{definition}
Notice that the tracks respect the dynamics: applying $f_0$ to a track gives a track of the previous generation.

When a passenger travels between two stations $s_1$ and $s_2$, they must follow a particular itinerary from $s_1$ to $s_2$.
If $s_1$ is the central station, then this itinerary is determined by the rule that the passenger stays as close as possible to its destination $s_2$ in the angular distance.
This also determines how to travel from the central station to a boundary point $\zeta\in \partial \mathbb D^*$, by continuity. 
See \cref{fig:Carleson1} and the next definition.


\begin{definition}
Let $\zeta=\exp(2\pi i\theta)\in\partial\D$. 
The \emph{central itinerary} of $\zeta$ is a path 
$\eta_\zeta = \gamma _{\sigma_0,\sigma_1} + \gamma_{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}+\ldots$ 
from the central station to $\zeta$, made of tracks between the stations 
$\sigma_0,\sigma_1,\dots$. It is defined inductively as follows:

Start at the central station $\sigma_0=s_{0,0}$. Suppose that we already chose $\sigma_0,\ldots,\sigma_k$. If there is a peripheral neighbor $\sigma$ of $\sigma_k$ that is closer peripherally to $\zeta$, meaning that
$$
\left|\Arg\left(\zeta\right)-\Arg\left(\sigma\right)\right|
< \left|\Arg\left(\zeta\right)-\Arg\left(\sigma_{k}\right)\right|,
$$
then take $\sigma_{k+1}=\sigma$. Otherwise, take $\sigma_{k+1}=\RadialSuccessor(\sigma)$.
\end{definition}

\input{figures/"marker path.tex"}

We identify the central itinerary $\eta_{\zeta}$ with its sequence of stations $(\sigma_0,\ldots)$. We record two properties of central itineraries:

\begin{itemize}
	\item No central itinerary $\eta_{\zeta}$ uses two consecutive peripheral tracks. In particular,
	\begin{equation}
	\label{generation-lower-bound}
		\operatorname{Generation}(\sigma_k)\geq \frac k2;
	\end{equation}
	
	\item Central itineraries are essentially equivariant under $f_{0}$, in the sense that
	\begin{equation*}
		f_{0}(\eta_{\zeta})=\eta{}_{f_{0}(\zeta)}\cup[s_{0,0},f_0(s_{0,0})]
	\end{equation*}
	for every $\zeta\in \partial \mathbb D^*$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
\label{def-disk-itinerary}
Given two distinct boundary points $\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}\in\partial\D^*$, form the central itineraries $\eta_{\zeta_{1}}=\left(\sigma_{n}^{1}\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ and $\eta_{\zeta_{2}}=\left(\sigma_{n}^{2}\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ and let  $\sigma=\sigma^1_i=\sigma^2_j$ be the last station that is in both $\eta_{\zeta_{1}}$ and $\eta_{\zeta_{2}}$.  
	 We define the \emph{itinerary} between  $\zeta_{1}$ and $\zeta_{2}$ to be the path 
$$
 \eta_{\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}}=  \left(\dots,\sigma_{i+2}^{1},\sigma_{i+1}^{1},\sigma,\sigma_{j+1}^{2},\sigma_{j+2}^{2},\dots\right).
$$

	This is a simple bi-infinite path connecting $\zeta_{1}$ and $\zeta_{2}$, see \cref{fig:Carleson2}. Note that itineraries are equivariant under the dynamics: we have  \begin{equation}
		f(\eta_{\zeta_1,\zeta_2})=\eta_{f(\zeta_1),f(\zeta_2)}
	\end{equation} for every pair of boundary points $\zeta_1,\zeta_2 \in \partial \mathbb D^*$ with $|\zeta_1-\zeta_2| < \sqrt{2}$.
\end{definition}
\input{"figures/marker path 2.tex"}

\section{Transporting the tracks} \label{rails-section}
For $c \in \heartsuit$, the Julia set of $f_c: z\mapsto z^2+c$ is a Jordan curve. The {\em Böttcher coordinate} $\psi$ is the unique conformal map $\D^{*}\to\Exterior(\mathcal{J}_c)$  which fixes $\infty$ and satisfies the conjugacy relation 
$$
f\circ\psi=\psi\circ f_{0}.
$$
The Böttcher coordinate $\psi$ extends to a homeomorphism between the unit circle $\partial\D$ and $\mathcal{J}_c$ by Carathéodory's
theorem. See \cite[Theorem 9.5]{milnor_book} for a proof of existence, 
relying on the explicit construction 
\begin{equation}
	\psi(z) \, = \, \lim_{n\to \infty} (f_0)^{\circ (-n)} \circ f^{\circ n}\, = \, \lim_{n\to \infty} {(f^{\circ n})}^{1/2^n}.	
\end{equation}

\input{figures/draw_dyadic_grid.tex}

We apply $\psi$ to the tracks that we constructed in $\mathbb D^*$ 
to obtain the corresponding tracks in $\Exterior(\mathcal{J}_c)$:
\begin{definition} \leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The 	\emph{stations} of $f_c$ are the points $\psi(s_{n,k})$.


\item The \emph{tracks} of $f_c$ are the curves of the form $\psi \left(\gamma_{s,s'}\right)$, where $\gamma_{s,s'}$ is a track. They are classified as express or peripheral according to the corresponding classification of $\gamma_{s,s'}$. 
Express tracks lie on the external rays of the filled Julia set $\mathcal K_c$, while peripheral tracks lie on the equipotentials of $\mathcal K_c$.

\item The \emph{itinerary} between a pair of points $(z_1,z_2)$ on $\mathcal J_c$ is
$\eta_{z_1,z_2}=\psi(\eta_{\zeta_1,\zeta_2})$, 
where $\zeta_i=\psi^{-1}(z_i)$ are the corresponding points on $\partial \mathbb D^*$. 
\end{enumerate}

We henceforth omit $c$ and $\psi$ from the notation for ease of reading. It will be clear from the context whether we work in $\mathbb D^*$ or in $\Exterior(\mathcal J)$.

%These itineraries can equivalently be obtained directly as in the case of $\mathbb D^*$, in terms of following the central itineraries from the common ancestor in the tree structure.
%Trivially since $\psi$ is a bijective correspondence between the two decompositions.
\end{definition}

When $c \in (-3/4, 1/4)$, $\psi\left((1,\infty)\right)\subseteq\R$ since $\mathcal{J}$ is symmetric with respect to the real line, and in particular, the central station $\psi(s_{0,0})$ lies on the real axis.


\section{Hyperbolic Maps}
In this section we prove the quasiconvexity of $\Exterior(\mathcal J)$ for parameters $c$ in the main cardioid $\heartsuit$.
Since the argument will involve iterating $f^{-1}$, 
we will need to exclude points around which there is no holomorphic inverse for some iterate $f^{\circ n}$:

\begin{definition}
	The \emph{post-critical set} of $f$ is the closure of the forward orbits 
	of the critical points,
	\begin{equation*}
		\Postcrit = \overline{\{f^{\circ n} (0): n \geq 1\} \cup \{\infty\}}.
	\end{equation*}	
\end{definition}
% As an indication for its relevance, notice that at points 
% $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit$ there is a local inverse of $f^{\circ n}$ for all $n \geq 0$.
For every $c \neq 0$, the post-critical set $\PostCrit$ of the map $f: z\mapsto z^2+c$ contains at least $3$ points (e.g.~$0$, $c$ and $\infty$) and consequently its complement $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit$
is a hyperbolic domain by \cref{thm:criterion-hyperbolic-domain}.

The map $f$ \emph{hyperbolic} if
 its post-critical set $\PostCrit$ is disjoint from its Julia set $\mathcal J$.
 This is equivalent to $f$ being expanding on $\mathcal J$:

 \begin{theorem}\label{theorem:hyperbolic_expanding}
Let $c \neq0$, and view $f: z\mapsto z^2+c$ as the map 
$$f: f^{-1}(\hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit) \to \hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit,$$
with the corresponding hyperbolic metrics. Then we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hyp-derivative-bound}
	\norm {f'(z)}_{\hyp} > 1
\end{equation} 
for every $z\in f^{-1}(\hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit)$,
where the hyperbolic derivative was defined in \cref{def:hyp-derivative}.
 \end{theorem}
 
 \begin{proof}{(Proof. \cite[Theorem 19.1]{milnor_book})}
	The map $f$ is a covering map, hence it is a local isometry as a map
	$$f: f^{-1}(\hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit) \to \hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit$$
	by \cref{thm:Schwarz}.
	We conclude by composing with the inclusion 
	$f^{-1}(\hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit) \xhookrightarrow{} 
	\hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit$, 
	which is a strict contraction by \cref{thm:Schwarz}.
 \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If $c \in \heartsuit$ and $c \neq 0$, then we have 
	\begin{equation}
		\norm {f'(z)}_{\hyp} \geq \kappa
	\end{equation} 
	for all $z \in \mathcal J$, for some constant $\kappa >1$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	By hyperbolicity 
	$ \mathcal J \subseteq f^{-1}(\hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit)$, 
	and the claim follows by compactness.
\end{proof} 
 
%  Hyperbolic maps enjoy the principle of the conformal elevator, 
%  which roughly says that any ball centered on the Julia set can be blown up to a definite size. 
%  More precisely, we have the following proposition:

% \begin{proposition}[The Principle of the Conformal Elevator] \label{elevator}
% 	Let $f$ be a hyperbolic rational map, $z\in \mathcal J$ be a point on the Julia set of $f$ and $r>0$. There exists some forward iterate $f^{\circ n}$ of $f$ which is injective on the ball $B(z,2r)$ such that
% 	$\diam {f^{\circ n}(B(z,r))}$ is bounded from below uniformly in $z$ and $r$. 
% \end{proposition}

\begin{corollary} \label{elevator for points on julia}
	Let $f$ be a hyperbolic quadratic map.
	There exists  $\epsilon > 0$ such that 
	every pair of points $z,w\in\mathcal{J}$
	 has a forward iterate $f^{\circ n}$ for which 
	 \begin{equation*}
		\left|f^{\circ n}(z)-f^{\circ n}(w)\right|>\epsilon.	
	 \end{equation*}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}	
	We first convert the bound of \cref{elevator for points on julia} from the hyperbolic metric
	to the Euclidean metric by passing to an iterate of $f$. 
	Indeed, for every iterate $f^{\circ m}$ we have
	\begin{equation}
		\norm {(f^{\circ m})'(z)}_{\hyp} \geq \kappa^m
	\end{equation} 
	for every point $z \in \mathcal J$ and every tangent vector $v$ at $z$.
	As the hyperbolic metric and the Euclidean metric are equivalent on $\mathcal J$,
	we may take $m$ large enough so that for $g=f^{\circ m}$ there is a uniform bound
	$|g'| > \mu$ on $\mathcal J$, for some constant $\mu  > 1$. 
	% For every $z \in \mathcal J$, there exists $\epsilon(z) >0$ such that $|z-w| < \epsilon(z)$ implies 
	% $|g(z)-g(w)| > \kappa |z-w|$.
	By compactness, there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that whenever $|z-w| < \epsilon$ on $\mathcal J$,
	we have $|g(z)-g(w)| \geq \mu |z-w|$. The claim follows by iterating $g$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	A point $z \in \mathcal J$ is \emph{rectifiably accessible} from $\Exterior(\mathcal J)$ if there is a rectifiable curve $\gamma: [0,1) \to \Exterior(\mathcal J)$ such that $\gamma (t) \to z$ as $t \to 1$.
\end{definition}

% To show quasiconvexity, 
% we need to first show that every point of $\mathcal J$ is rectifiably accessible.
We are now ready to show quasiconvexity in the hyperbolic case:

\begin{theorem}  Let $f:z \mapsto z^2+c$ be a quadratic map with $c \in \heartsuit$. \leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont(\roman*)]

\item Given $z\in\mathcal{J}$ decompose its central itinerary into tracks, 
\begin{equation*}
\eta_z = \gamma _1 +\gamma_2 +\dots.
\end{equation*}
We have the estimate
\begin{equation*}
\Length(\gamma_{k})\lesssim\theta^{k},
\end{equation*}
uniformly in $z$, for some constant $\theta=\theta(c)<1$. 
In particular, any point on \(\mathcal{J}\) is rectifiably accessible.

\item The domain $\Exterior(\mathcal{J})$ is quasiconvex with the itineraries $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ as certificates.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} \leavevmode
(i) For $c=0$, this is a direct computation. 
Suppose $c \neq 0$, and let $\Postcrit$ be the post-critical set of $f$.

% The map $f: \hat {\mathbb C} \setminus f^{-1}(\PostCrit) \to \hat {\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit$ is an isometry,

% Since $\# \mathcal P \geq 3$,  the Schwarz lemma implies that $f: \hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit \to\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$ is expanding in the hyperbolic metric of $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$.


%In particular, any inverse branch $f^{-1}: \hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit \to\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$ is a strict contraction.

Any branch of $f^{-1}: \hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit \to \hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$
% potentially defined only in a subdomain
is a strict hyperbolic contraction by \cref{theorem:hyperbolic_expanding}.

% Indeed, we may decompose this map as the hyperbolic isometry 
% $\tilde f^{-1}:\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit \to \hat{\mathbb C} \setminus f^{-1} (\Postcrit)$,
% composed with the strict inclusion $\iota: \hat{\mathbb C} \setminus f^{-1} (\Postcrit)  \to \hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$,
% which is contracting by Schwarz's lemma.
% See \cite[Theorem 3.5]{mcmullen_1994} for further details.

Let $B(0,R) \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a ball large enough that it contains every central itinerary. 
By hyperbolicity, $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit$ contains $\overline{\Exterior(\mathcal{J})}$.
Thus $\Exterior(\mathcal{J}) \cap B(0,R)$ is compactly contained in $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$, and
there is a constant $\theta<1$ such that $\Vert (f^{-1})' \Vert_{\hyp}< \theta$ on $\Exterior(\mathcal{J}) \cap B(0,R)$. Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\HypLength(\gamma_k)  & \leq \theta \cdot \HypLength(f(\gamma_k))\\ & \leq  \dots
	\\ & \leq \theta^k \cdot \HypLength(f^{\circ k}(\gamma_k)),
	\\ & \lesssim \theta^k,
\end{align*}
where the last inequality holds since $f^{\circ k}(\gamma_k)$ lies 
on the real axis in case $\gamma_k$ is an express track, 
or on the equipotential $\psi(\{ |z| = \sqrt 2\})$ otherwise.

As the hyperbolic metric is equivalent to the Euclidean metric on compact subsets
of $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \PostCrit$,
we conclude that $\Length(\gamma_k) \lesssim \theta^k$ as well.

% The corresponding bound $\Length(\delta_k) \lesssim \theta^k$ for peripheral tracks 
% follows in an analogous manner. 
% Alternatively, it can be obtained from the bound for $\Length(\gamma_k)$ 
% using Koebe's distortion theorem.
Thus any point on $\mathcal J$ can be reached from the central station 
$s_{0,0}$ by a curve of bounded length.

(ii) By \cref{elevator for points on julia}, 
there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that any two points are $\epsilon$-apart 
under some iterate of $f$. 
Let $z_{1},z_{2}\in\mathcal{J}(f)$. If $\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|\geq\epsilon,$ 
we are done since the length of $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ is uniformly bounded above by part (i).
On the other hand, if 
$\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|<\epsilon$,
then there is an iterate $f^{\circ n}$ for which
\begin{equation}
	|w_1-w_2|:=\left|f^{\circ n}(z_{1})-f^{\circ n}(z_{2})\right|\geq\epsilon
\end{equation}
and we have a uniform bound on
$$\frac{\Length\left(\eta_{w_1,w_2}\right)}{|w_1-w_2|}$$ as before.
As $\eta_{w_1, w_2}$ is contained in $B(0,R) \cap \Exterior(\mathcal J)$, it is relatively separated from the post-critical set. We are done by Lemma \ref{koebe-quasiconvexity}.
\end{proof}

%%--BEGIN COMMENT
\begin{comment}

Thus we are left with showing that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\Length\left(\eta_{z_{1},z_{2}}\right)}{|z_1-z_2|}\asymp\frac{\Length\left(\eta_{w_1,w_2}\right)}{|w_1-w_2|},
\end{equation}
which we rewrite as
% , denoting $g=f^{\circ n}$, that 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hyperbolic-distortion-goal}
	\frac{|z_1-z_2|}{|w_1-w_2|}
	\asymp
	\frac{\Length\left(\eta_{z_{1},z_{2}}\right)}{\Length\left(\eta_{w_1,w_2}\right)}.
\end{equation}

We shall now deduce \cref{eq:hyperbolic-distortion-goal} from a distortion argument.
Since $\Postcrit$ is compactly contained in $\mathcal K$, we may enlarge $\Postcrit$ to a compact connected set 
$\tilde {\PostCrit} \subset \mathcal K$ while maintaining a definite distance from the boundary $\mathcal J$.
By \cref{thm: rel-dist-bounds-modulus},
% since $f^{\circ n}$ sends $(z_1,z_2)$ to $(w_1,w_2)$ and sends $\eta_{z_{1},z_{2}}$ to $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$.
there is a topological ball $B=B(z_1,z_2)$ containing the itinerary $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ and having
a definite modulus inside $\hat{\mathbb C }\setminus \tilde{\PostCrit}$.

% To construct the part of $B$ outside $\mathcal K$ it to enough treat the round case $c=0$ and then apply 
% the conjugacy $\psi$. The part inside $\mathcal K$ can just be a path that stays closer
% to $\mathcal J$ that $\dist{\mathcal J, \Postcrit}$.

% TODO: details for why it exists.
% Also is $\hat{\mathbb C }\setminus \PostCrit(g)$ really the correct domain or its preimage or what?

Denoting $f^{\circ n}$ by $g$, 
we apply \cref{Koebe} on a branch of $g^{-1}$ defined in all of $B$ and sending $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ to $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$.
Such a branch exists because $B$ is disjoint from $\PostCrit$ and since we can ensure that $B$ does not encircle the origin by 
removing an external ray disjoint from $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$. \textcolor{red}{(Can I prove it?)}

It follows that
\begin{equation}
	\frac {|z_1-z_2|}{|w_1-w_2|} \asymp |(g^{-1})'(x)| \asymp
	\frac{\Length\left(\eta_{z_{1},z_{2}}\right)}{\Length\left(g(\eta_{z_1,z_2})\right)}.
\end{equation}
for any point $x \in B$, as needed.

\section{The Cauliflower}
In this section, $c=\frac 14$ and $f=f_{1/4}: z\mapsto z^2+ \frac 14$.
%The Cauliflower has cusps at the landing points of the dyadic external rays, i.e. the points whose central itinerary has only finitely-many peripheral tracks.
Our goal is to prove the quasiconvexity of $\Exterior(\mathcal{J})$, \cref{quasiconvex-Cauliflower}. 
This is more complicated than the hyperbolic case, 
because the post-critical set $\PostCrit$ of $f$ accumulates at the parabolic fixed point $p=\frac 12$. 
One no longer has a uniform bound on the distortion of inverse iterates, 
and we cannot immediately deduce the quasiconvexity of the itinerary $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ from the quasiconvexity of $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ using Koebe's distortion theorem. 
As a substitute, we present an analogue of the principle of the conformal elevator in this parabolic setting.

\subsection{Itineraries have finite length}
We first show that each itinerary $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ has a finite length. 
We will in fact show an exponential decay of the lengths of the constituent tracks. 
For this to hold it is necessary to glue together consecutive express tracks: 
for example, the tracks in the central itinerary that lies on the real axis, $\eta_{1/2}$, 
have only a quadratic rate of length decay. To fix this, we introduce:

\begin{definition}
	The \emph{reduced decomposition} of an itinerary $\eta$ is the unique decomposition $\eta=\gamma_1 + \delta_1 + \dots$ where each $\gamma_i$ is a concatenation of express tracks and $\delta_i$ consists of a single peripheral track.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:finite-length}
	Let $z \in \mathcal J$, and let $\eta_z= \gamma_1 + \delta_1 + \dots  $ be the reduced decomposition of its central itinerary. Then $\Length(\gamma_k)\lesssim \theta^k$ and $\Length(\delta_k)\lesssim \theta^k$ for some $\theta < 1$. In particular, $\Length(\eta_z)<\infty$ and all points $z\mathcal \in \mathcal J$ are rectifiably accessible.
\end{proposition}

For the proof, let $\mathcal U_{-1}$ be the Jordan domain enclosed by the unit circle, 
the rightmost itinerary starting from the pre-central station and the leftmost one. 
See \cref{fig:dyadic_grid}.
This domain is constructed so that it contains all itineraries that start at the station 
$s_{1,1} = \psi(-\sqrt{2})$, the preimage of the central station under $f$. Its crucial property is: 
% call $s_{-1}:=s_{1,1}$ the \emph{pre-central station}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma-enough-visits-of-premain_station}
	Let $\gamma = \gamma_1 + \delta_1 + \dots $ be the reduced decomposition of an itinerary $\gamma$. Then for every $k > 1$, there exist $k-1$ iterates $n_1 < \dots < n_{k-1}$ such that $f^{\circ {n_i}}(\gamma_k) \subset \mathcal U_{-1}$. % This is actually an off-by-1 lie, since n_1=0 has no predecessor.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Every station $s \not \in (0, \infty)$ has a first iterate $f^{\circ n_s}(s)$ lying on the negative real axis $(-\infty, 0)$.
	For any $i \in \{2, \dots, k-1\}$, let $s_i$ be the first station of $\gamma _i$ and take $n_i := n_{s_i}$.
	By the definition of $\,\mathcal U_{-1}$, the itinerary $f^{\circ n_i}(\gamma)$ is contained in  $\,\mathcal U_{-1}$ from the station $f^{\circ n_i}(s_i)$ onwards, and in particular $f^{\circ n_i}(\gamma_k) \subset \mathcal U_{-1}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof (\cref{prop:finite-length})] 
There is a uniform bound $\Vert (f^{-1})' \Vert_{\hyp}< \theta < 1$ on $\mathcal U_{-1}$
with respect to the hyperbolic metric of the domain $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$, for both branches $f^{-1}: \mathcal U_{-1} \to \mathcal U_{\pm i}$. 
This follows from \cref{theorem:hyperbolic_expanding}, in the slightly more general formulation of \cite[Theorem 3.5]{mcmullen_1994},
since $\mathcal U_{-1}$ is compactly contained in $\hat{\mathbb C} \setminus \Postcrit$.

In the notation of \cref{lemma-enough-visits-of-premain_station}, we then have 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\HypLength(\gamma_k)  &  \leq \HypLength(f^{\circ (n_1-1)}(\gamma_k)) \\ & \leq \theta \cdot \HypLength(f^{\circ n_1}(\gamma_k))\\ & \leq  \dots
	\\ & \leq \theta^k \cdot \HypLength(f^{\circ n_k}(\gamma_k))
		\\ & \lesssim \theta^k.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

As in the hyperbolic case, we infer that $\Length(\gamma_k) \lesssim \theta^k$ 
by the equivalence on $B(0,R) \setminus \mathcal P$ 
of the Euclidean metric and the hyperbolic metric. 
% This proves the bound for express tracks. The analogous bound $\Length(\delta_k)\lesssim \theta^k$ for peripheral tracks is similar.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Some Estimates and Notation}

To estimate the length of express tracks, we introduce the notations $s_n := s_{n, 0}$ and 
\begin{equation}
	\ell_n := \Length([s_{n},s_{n+1}]) = s_{n}-s_{n+1}.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem-ell_n}
	The lengths ${\ell_n}$ satisfy:
	
	{\em (i)}
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ell_n1}
		\frac {|p-s_n|}{\ell_n} \to \infty,
	\end{equation}
	
	{\em (ii)}
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ell_n2}
		\frac{\ell_n}{\ell_{n+1}} \to 1.
	\end{equation}
	In particular, for any $C > 0$, there is a sufficiently large integer $d$ such that
	\begin{align*}
		\ell_{m}+\ldots+\ell_{n} \geq C (\ell_m+\ell_n)
	\end{align*}
	whenever $|m-n| \geq d$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Using the affine conjugacy of the map $f$ to the map $g: z\mapsto z^2+z$, which sends the parabolic fixed point $\frac{1}{2}$ of $f$ to $0$, one can show that
$$
\ell_n \asymp \frac{1}{n^2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad |p - s_n| \asymp \frac{1}{n}.
$$
After a little arithmetic, we get (\ref{eq:ell_n1}) and (\ref{eq:ell_n2}).
\end{proof}

% If an itinerary $\gamma$ is relatively separated from $\PostCrit$, then the preimages of $\gamma$ under $f$ have bounded distortion. 
% In particular, if $\gamma$ is a quasiconvexity certificate, 
% then Koebe's distortion theorem implies that $f^{-1}(\gamma)$ is also a certificate with a comparable constant.

\begin{lemma}
There exists a constant $k>0$ such that for any pair of points $z_1, z_2 \in \mathcal J$, we have 
$|f(z_1)-f(z_2)| \leq k|z_1-z_2|$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We have 
	\begin{equation}
		|f(z_1)-f(z_2)| = \left |\int_{z_1} ^{z_2} f(z) dz \right | \leq k|z_1-z_2|	
	\end{equation}
for $k=\max_{z \in B} |f'(z)|$, where $B$ is any ball containing $\mathcal J$. 
\end{proof}
 
\subsection{Dynamics near the parabolic fixed point}

The purpose of the following definition is to organize points on the Julia set $\mathcal J$ according to their distance from the main cusp $z=1/2$ in an $f$-invariant way. We decompose the points of $\mathcal J$ according to the first \emph{departure}\,: the first time that the central itinerary makes a turn.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/cauliflower_equipotentials2.png}
    \caption{The Cauliflower near the parabolic point $p=1/2$.}
    \label{fig:my_figure}
\end{figure}
\input{"figures/marker path 3.tex"}
\begin{definition}

Let $n \in \mathbb N$. We define the $n$-th \emph{departure set} $I_{n, \mathbb D} \subset \partial \mathbb D ^*$ to be the set of points $\zeta \in \partial \mathbb D^*$ whose central itinerary $\eta_{\zeta}$ starts with $n$ express tracks, followed by a peripheral track.
See \cref{fig:departure-decomposition}.
\end{definition}

This decomposition is invariant under $f_0$ in the sense that $f_0(I_{n+1, \mathbb D})=I_{n, \mathbb D}$, because of the invariance of $\eta _\zeta$.
Applying the Böttcher map $\psi$, we obtain a corresponding departure decomposition $I_n = \psi(I_{n, \mathbb D})$ of $\mathcal J$ that is invariant under $f$.

We now use this decomposition to analyze the case where the points $w_1,w_2$ lie in ``well-separated cusps''. Namely, suppose that
\begin{align} \label{parabolic separation}
	w_1 \in I_n, \quad w_2 \in I_m, \quad m-n > d,
\end{align}
where $d$ is a sufficiently large integer, to be chosen later. 
This gives some control from below on $|w_1-w_2|$. 
We represent the itinerary $\eta=\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ as a concatenation of three paths: the radial segment $\gamma_{m,n}=[s_{m,0},s_{n,0}]$ and the two other components, $\gamma _m$ and $\gamma_n$. See \cref{fig:Three-parts-of-eta} for the picture in the exterior unit disk.
Thus we have
\begin{equation}
	\Length(\eta)=\Length(\gamma_m)+\Length(\gamma_{m,n})+\Length(\gamma_n).
\end{equation}

\input{"figures/departure-decomposition.tex"}

The condition $m-n \geq d$ prevents the line segment $\gamma _{m,n}$ from being small in comparison to $\gamma_m$ and $\gamma_n$:
\begin{proposition}
\label {case-3-proof}
There exists a sufficiently large integer $d$ so that 
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:triangle-comparison}
		\Length(\gamma_{m,n}) \asymp |w_1-w_2|,
	\end{equation}
	whenever $m-n \geq d$.
\end{proposition}

We henceforth fix a value of $d$ as in the proposition.
\begin{proof}
We first make two elementary observations. Koebe's distortion theorem applied to the iterates of $f^{-1}$ shows that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gamma_m_not_large}
		\Length(\gamma_m) \leq C \ell_m,
	\end{equation}
for some constant $C \geq 0$. Notice that (\ref{eq:gamma_m_not_large}) holds for $m=1$ by \cref{prop:finite-length}, which gives a uniform bound on the length of an itinerary.

Meanwhile, by \cref{lem-ell_n}, there exists an integer $d$ such that
\begin{align}
C(\ell_m + \ell _n) \leq \frac{\Length(\gamma_{m,n})}{2}
\end{align}
whenever $m-n \geq d$.

By the triangle inequality, we have
\begin{align*} 
		\bigl | \Length(\gamma_{m,n}) - |w_1-w_2| \bigr | & \le \Length(\gamma_m)+\Length(\gamma_n) \\
		& \le \frac{\Length(\gamma_{m,n})}{2},
\end{align*}
which clearly implies (\ref{eq:triangle-comparison}).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Quasiconvexity: three special cases}

We now show that the itineraries $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ are certificates in three special cases. To state them, we introduce some notation.

\subsubsection{Notation}
For each $n$, we denote by  $\alpha_n$ the union of the two outermost tracks emanating from the station $s_{n,0}$. 
Notice that the curves $\alpha_n$ are pairwise disjoint since this is true for their pullbacks to the exterior unit disk.

We define the constants $C_1, C_2, \epsilon$ as follows. We first choose $C_1 \ge 2$, then we let $C_2 = C_1 + d+2$ and choose $\epsilon >0$ small enough so that we have 
\begin{equation}
	\dist(\alpha_{C_2}, \alpha_{C_1}) \geq k \epsilon.
\end{equation}

The constant $C_2$ was chosen so that for any pair $(m,n)$ of integers, we have at least one of the following three cases: either $m,n$ are both greater than $C_1$, or both are smaller than $C_2$, or $|m-n| > d$.

\subsubsection{Three Special Cases}
In this section we treat the following special cases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $|w_1-w_2| \geq  \epsilon$, $\quad |m-n|<d$, $\quad 2 \le m,n < C_2$; %relatively separated
	\item $|w_1-w_2| \geq \epsilon$, $\quad |m-n|<d$, $\quad  m,n> C_1$; %relatively separated
	\item $|w_1-w_2| \leq k \epsilon$, $\quad |m-n| \geq d$.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that Case 2 overlaps with Case 1.
 We denote the domain enclosed by $\alpha_m, \alpha_n$ and $\mathcal J$ by $\mathcal K_{m,n}$, and denote the domain enclosed by $\mathcal J$ and $\alpha_n$ by $\mathcal K_n$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $w_1 \in I_m$ and $w_2 \in I_n$, for $n \geq m \geq 2$. Then the itinerary $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ is contained in the domain $\mathcal K_{m,n+1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label{case 1 rel. sep}
Let $w_1,w_2 \in \mathcal J$. In each of the three special cases, the itinerary $\gamma _{w_1,w_2}$ is a quasiconvexity certificate. In Cases 1 and 2, $\gamma _{w_1,w_2}$ is relatively separated.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\emph{Case 1.} In this case, the itinerary is contained in the domain $\mathcal K_{2, C_2+1}$.
Since $\dist(\mathcal K_{2, C_2+1}, \mathcal P)>0$, $\gamma _{w_1,w_2}$ is $\eta$-relatively separated for some $\eta>0$. 

\emph{Case 2.}
Assuming without loss of generality that $n \geq m$, the itinerary is contained in $\mathcal K_{m,n+1}$. By Koebe's distortion theorem, $\gamma _{w_1,w_2}$ is also relatively separated.

\emph{Case 3} is the content of \cref{case-3-proof}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Quasiconvexity: general case}
We apply a stopping time argument to promote the quasiconvexity of $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ to the quasiconvexity of $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$, thereby proving the following theorem:

\begin{theorem} \label{quasiconvex-Cauliflower}
	The domain $\Exterior(\mathcal{J})$ is quasiconvex, with the itineraries $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ as certificates.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof. (Parabolic Conformal Elevator on $\mathcal J$)] \label{parabolic-elevator}
Let  $(z_1,z_2)$ be a pair of points in $\mathcal J$. Repeatedly apply $f$ to $(z_1, z_2)$ until either of the three special cases occurs. Denote by $w_i=f^{\circ N}(z_i)$ the resulting points. We have already proved that the itinerary $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ satisfies
\begin{equation*}
	\Length(\eta_{w_1,w_2}) \leq A |w_1-w_2|,
\end{equation*}
for some $A>0$. We deduce that the original pair of points $(z_1,z_2)$ enjoys a similar estimate,
\begin{equation*}
	\Length(\eta_{z_1,z_2}) \leq C |z_1-z_2|,
\end{equation*}
where $C$ depends only on $A$.

In Cases 1 and 2, we are done by \cref{case 1 rel. sep}. In Case 3, 
the itinerary $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ is contained in $\mathcal K_2$. Let $\mathcal K_{-2}$ be the preimage of $\mathcal K_2$ under $f$ that contains the negative preimage $f^{-1}(p)=-\tfrac 12$ of the cusp $p$. 
As the domain $\mathcal K_{-2}$ is relatively separated from $\PostCrit$ and contains the curve 
$f^{\circ (N-1)}(\eta_{z_1,z_2}) = \eta_{f^{-1}(w_1),f^{-1}(w_2)}$,
we may use Koebe's distortion theorem to conclude that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\Length(\eta_{z_1,z_2})}{|z_1-z_2|} \, \asymp \,
		\frac{\Length(\eta_{f^{-1}(w_1),f^{-1}(w_2)})}{|f^{-1}(w_1)-f^{-1}(w_2)|} \, \asymp \,
		\frac{\Length(\eta_{w_1,w_2})}{|w_1-w_2|}
\end{equation}
as desired.
\end{proof}
