\captionof{figure}{A convenient representation of the dyadic grid in the BÃ¶ttcher coordinates.
 The horizontal axis is the external ray angle, and the vertical axis is the equipotential $|\psi ^{-1}(z)|$, plotted on a log scale. 
 The rightmost edge is glued to the leftmost edge.
 Stations are marked in red, and the segments connecting adjacent stations are tracks. An express track is a vertical segment, and a peripheral track is horizontal.}
