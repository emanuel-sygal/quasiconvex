\section{Introduction}
A domain $\Omega\subseteq\C$ is called \textbf{quasiconvex }if its
intrinsic metric is comparable to the ambient Euclidean metric. Explicitly,
this means that there exists a constant $A\geq1$ such that every
two points $z_{1},z_{2}\in\Omega$ have a rectifiable path $\gamma:\left[0,1\right]\to\Omega$
connecting them which satisfies
\[
\Length(\gamma)\leq A\cdot\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|.
\]
We call such a path $\gamma$ a \emph{quasiconvexity certificate }for\emph{
$z_{1},z_{2}$.}
% or "witness"

If $\Omega$ is the interior of a Jordan curve, then by \cite[Corollary F]{hakobyan_euclidean_2008}
it is enough to find certificates for points $z_{1},z_{2}$ that are
on the boundary curve $\partial\Omega$.%
\begin{comment}
It is also shown in \cite{hakobyan_euclidean_2008} that any quasidisk is quasiconvex.
\end{comment}

The \emph{cauliflower} is the filled Julia set of the map $z^2+\frac 14$.
We show that its complement, $\mathrm{Exterior}(\mathcal{J}(z^{2}+1/4))$,
is quasiconvex. We then adapt our argument to establish that the exterior of the developed deltoid is quasiconvex.



One motivation to study quasiconvexity stems from its connection with the
John property: If $\Omega$ is a quasiconvex Jordan domain, then its complement has a John interior. See \cite[Corollary 3.4]{hakobyan_euclidean_2008} for a proof.

Thus this result is a strengthening of \cite[Theorem 6.1]{carleson_julia_1994}, which shows that the cauliflower is a John domain directly.

This result also has a function-theoretic interpretation: By \cite[Theorem 1.1]{koskela_geometric_2010}, it shows that the cauliflower is a BV-extension domain.
% A bounded, simply connected planar domain is a BV-extension domain if and only if its complement is quasiconvex.

\begin{comment}
The Filled Julia set of $z^{2}+1/4$, called the cauliflower, has
an inward-pointing cusp and hence is not quasiconvex.
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
Thus, for any $c$ in 

For values $c$ in quadratic polynomials $f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$
\end{comment}
\begin{comment}
If $f_{c}$ has an attracting fixed point then its Julia set $\mathcal{J}(f_{c})$
is a quasicircle, hence its interior and exterior are both quasiconvex.
This is the case for values of $c$ in the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot
set.
, i.e.\ for 
\[
c\in\left\{ -\frac{\lambda}{2}-\frac{\lambda^{2}}{4}:\,\left|\lambda\right|<1\right\} .
\]
\end{comment}

\subsection{Sketch of the argument}

We show quasiconvexity by an explicit construction of a certificate connecting two given points on the Julia set.

We first build certificates for the exterior unit disk $\mathbb D ^*$ and then transport them by the BÃ¶ttcher coordinate $\psi$ of $f_{1/4}$ to the exterior of the cauliflower.

In order to retain control on the certificates after applying $\psi$, we build the certificates on $\mathbb D^*$ in a manner invariant under the map $f_0: z\mapsto z^2$. This is done by only traveling along the boundaries of Carleson boxes in $\mathbb D^{*}$. 

The image of a certificate $c$ in $\mathbb D^{*}$ under the conjugacy $\psi$ is invariant under $f_{1/4}$. We use this invariance to show that $\psi(c)$ is indeed a certificate, by employing a parabolic variant of the principle of the conformal elevator: We repeatedly apply $f_{1/4}$ on $\psi(c)$ until either the distance between the endpoints grows to a definite size or one endpoint is attracted sufficiently quickly to the parabolic fixed point $1/2$. The latter case requires a more delicate treatment.

To facilitate the reading, we separate this latter difficulty by first demonstrating the proof in the hyperbolic case of maps $f_c$ where  $c\in\left(-\frac 34,\frac{1}{4}\right)$. In this case the usual conformal elevator applies. We then treat the $c=\frac 14$ case.

% Although $J_{0.1}^{\text{exterior}}$ is known in advance to be quasiconvex, in virtue of being a quasidisk.


\section{The exterior disk}

\begin{comment}
The exterior $\D^{*}=\left\{ \left|z\right|>1\right\} $ of the unit
disk is trivially quasiconvex by connecting points along the perimeter of the circle. However, these paths follow the boundary too closely and their length would blow up if we transport them to the exterior of $\mathcal{J}(f_{c})$, $c\neq0$, via the Riemann map. Instead,
\end{comment}

We connect boundary points by moving along the boundaries of Carleson boxes which we now define.
\begin{definition}
Let $n\in\N_{0}$ and $k\in\left\{ 0,\ldots,2^{n}-1\right\} $. We
call the set
%\[B_{n,k}=\exp\left(\biggl(2^{-n-1}\log2,\,2^{-n}\log2\biggl]\times\biggl(\frac{k}{2^{n}}2\pi,\,\frac{(k+1)}{2^{n}}2\pi\biggl]\right)\]

\[
B_{n,k}=\left\{ z:\quad\left|z\right|\in\biggl(2^{2^{-n}},2^{2^{-n-1}}\biggl],\qquad\mathrm{arg}(z)\in\biggl(\frac{k}{2^{n}}2\pi,\frac{(k+1)}{2^{n}}2\pi\biggl]\right\} 
\]
a \emph{Carleson box}\,.
Observe that for a fixed $n$, the union $\bigsqcup_{k=0}^{2^{n}-1}B_{k,n}$
is a partition of the annulus 
\[
\left\{ 2^{2^{-n-1}}<\left|z\right|\leq2^{2^{-n}}\right\} 
\]
 into $2^{n}$ equally-spaced sectors.
 
The \emph{Carleson box decomposition} is the partition of $\D^{*}$ which consists of $f_{0}$-Carleson
boxes:
\[
\D^{*}=\left\{ \zeta:\,\left|\zeta\right|>2\right\} \sqcup\bigsqcup_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigsqcup_{k=0}^{2^{n}-1}B_{n,k}.
\]
The crucial property of this decomposition is its invariance under $f_{0}$,
stemming from the relation
\begin{equation*}
f_{0}\left(B_{n+1,k}\right)=B_{n,\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor}.
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

We describe the motion along Carleson boxes using the metaphor of a passenger who travels by trains. 
We now define \enquote{stations} and \enquote{tracks}.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{terminal} is a point $\zeta \in \partial \mathbb D^*$ on the unit circle.
The \emph{central station} is the point\emph{ $s_{0,0}=2$. Stations
}are the iterated preimages of the central station under the map $f_{0}:\zeta\mapsto \zeta^{2}$.
We index them as 
\[
s_{n,k}=2^{2^{-n}}\exp\left(\frac{k}{2^{n}}2\pi i\right),\qquad n\in\N_{0},\quad k\in\left\{ 0,\ldots,2^{n}-1\right\} .
\]

Stations are naturally structured in a binary tree, where the root
is the central station $2$ and the children of a node are its preimages.
The $2^{n}$ stations of generation $n$ in the tree are equally spaced
on the circle $C_{n}=\left\{ \left|\zeta\right|=2^{1/2^{n}}\right\} $. 


\end{definition}

We next lay two types of \enquote{rail tracks} on the boundaries of Carleson boxes, which we use to travel between stations.

\begin{definition}
Let $s=s_{n,k}$ be a station.

1. The \emph{peripheral neighbors} of $s$ are $s_{n,\left(k\pm1\right)\mod2^{n}}$,
the two stations adjacent to $s_{n,k}$ on $C_{n}$.

2. Given a peripheral neighbor $s'$ of $s$, the \emph{peripheral
	track }$\gamma_{s,s'}$ from $s$ to $s'$
is the short arc of the circle $C_{n}$ connecting $s$ to $s'$.

3. The \emph{radial successor} of $s$ is $\RadialSuccessor(s)=s_{n+1,2k}$, the unique station of generation $n+1$ on the radial segment $[0,s]$.

4. Denote $s'=\RadialSuccessor(s)$, then the \emph{Express track} $\gamma_{s,s'}$ from $s$ to $s'$ is the radial segment $[s,s']$.

%5. An \emph{itinerary} is a sequence of stations $\left(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\ldots\right)$. We identify an itinerary with the curve obtained by traveling along it.
\end{definition}

Notice that the tracks preserve the dynamics: applying $\zeta\mapsto \zeta^{2}$
to a peripheral track between $s,s'$ gives a peripheral track between the
parents of $s,s'$ in the tree, and likewise for an express track.

When a passenger purchases a ticket between two stations $s_1$ and $s_2$, they must follow a particular itinerary to get from $s_1$ to $s_2$.
If $s_1$ is the central station, then this compulsory itinerary is determined by the rule that the passenger always stays as close as possible to its destination in the peripheral distance. 
This also determines how to travel from the central station to a terminal $\zeta\in \partial \mathbb D^*$, by continuity. See \cref{fig:Carleson1} and the next definition.

% There is a caveat in the analogy, because this gives rise to an itinerary between any two points and if we approximate terminal points by bearby stations then we do not get the same path.

\begin{definition}
Let $\zeta=\exp(2\pi i\theta)\in\partial\D$. The \emph{itinerary} $\eta_\zeta$ from the central station to $\zeta$ is a path 
$\eta_\zeta = \gamma _{\sigma_0,\sigma_1} + \gamma_{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}+\ldots$ made of tracks between stations $\sigma_0,\sigma_1,\ldots$, defined inductively as follows:

Start at the main station $\sigma_0=s_{0,0}$. Suppose that we already chose $\sigma_0,\ldots,\sigma_k$. If there is a peripheral neighbor $\sigma$ of $\sigma_k$ that is closer peripherally to $\zeta$, meaning that $$\left|\Arg\left(\zeta\right)-\Arg\left(\sigma\right)\right|
< \left|\Arg\left(\zeta\right)-\Arg\left(\sigma_{k}\right)\right|,$$ then take $\sigma_{k+1}=\sigma$. Otherwise, take 
$\sigma_{k+1}=\RadialSuccessor(\sigma)$.
\end{definition}

\input{"marker path.tex"}

We call $\eta_{\zeta}$ the \emph{central itinerary} of $\zeta$ and identify $\eta_{\zeta}$ with its sequence of stations $(\sigma_0,\ldots)$.

Note that there are no two consecutive peripheral tracks in $\eta_{\zeta}$ and thus 
\begin{equation} \label{generation-lower-bound}
\operatorname{Generation}(\sigma_k)\geq \frac k2.
\end{equation}

Also note that the itineraries are invariant under $f_{0}$, in the sense that
\begin{equation*}
f_{0}(\eta_{\zeta})=\eta{}_{f_{0}(\zeta)}\cup[s_{0,0},f_0(s_{0,0})]
\end{equation*}
for every $\zeta\in\partial\D$.

\begin{lemma} \label{track_decay}
Let $\zeta\in \partial \mathbb D^*$. Decompose the central itinerary $\eta_{\zeta}$ into its constituent tracks, 
$$\eta_{\zeta}=\gamma _1 + \gamma_2\ldots .$$ 
	Then we have the estimate $$\Length(\gamma_{k})\lesssim2^{-k}$$ uniformly in $\zeta$. 
In particular, the total length of $\eta_\zeta$ is bounded uniformly in $\zeta$.
\end{lemma}


%In particular, the length of a suffix $\sigma_{k}+\sigma_{k+1}+\ldots$ decays exponentially in $k$, uniformly in $\zeta$.

We now define the would-be certificates. We do this by traveling as efficiently as possible, constrained to staying on the central itineraries:

%Note that this may result in an "inefficient" itinerary: two stations that are peripheral neighbors might have a rather long itinerary between them.
%By continuity, this defines the itinerary between any two terminals $\zeta_1$ and $\zeta_2$:

% If two terminals are bearby then their common ancestor $N$ must be large, because if $N$ is small then the points must be far away.*/-+

\begin{definition} \label{def-disk-itinerary} Let $\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}\in\partial\D^*$ be two distinct terminals, let  $\eta_{\zeta_{1}}=\left(\sigma_{n}^{1}\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ and 
	$\eta_{\zeta_{2}}=\left(\sigma_{n}^{2}\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
	 be the corresponding central itineraries and let  $\sigma=\sigma^1_i=\sigma^2_j$ be the last station that is in both $\eta_{\zeta_{1}}$ and $\eta_{\zeta_{2}}$. Note that $\sigma$ is well-defined.
	 We define the \emph{itinerary} between  $\zeta_{1}$ and $\zeta_{2}$ to be the path  %$\eta_{\zeta_{i}}^{\text{truncated}}=\left(\sigma_{N},\sigma_{N+1}^{i},\ldots\right)$ be the truncated paths. Then
 \begin{gather*}
 \eta_{\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}}=  \left(\dots,\sigma_{i+2}^{1},\sigma_{i+1}^{1},\sigma,\sigma_{j+1}^{2},\sigma_{j+2}^{2},\dots\right).
 \end{gather*}
	This is a simple bi-infinite path connecting $\zeta_{1}$ and $\zeta_{2}$. See \cref{fig:Carleson2}. 
\end{definition}
\input{"marker path 2.tex"}

\begin{theorem} \label{quasiconvex disk}
The domain $\D^{*}$ is quasiconvex with the itineraries $\eta_{\zeta_1,\zeta_2}$ as certificates.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We keep the notations of \cref{def-disk-itinerary}.
We decompose the itinerary into two paths, so that
\begin{equation}
\Length(\eta_{\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}})=\Length\left(\sigma,\sigma_{j+1}^{2},\sigma_{j+2}^{2},\dots\right)
+\Length\left(\sigma,\sigma_{i+1}^{1},\sigma_{i+2}^{1},\dots\right),
\end{equation}
and bound each summand using \cref{track_decay}: if $\operatorname{Generation}(\sigma)=N$, then 
\begin{align}
\Length(\eta_{\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}})
&\lesssim 2 \sum_{k=N}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{k}} \\ 
&\lesssim2^{-N}. \label{eq:1}
\end{align}

On the other hand 

\begin{equation}
\left|\zeta_{1}-\zeta_{2}\right|
\asymp
	\left|\Arg\left(\zeta_{1}\right)-\Arg\left(\zeta_{2}\right)\right|,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\left|\Arg\left(\zeta_{1}\right)-\Arg\left(\zeta_{2}\right)\right| \geq \frac {2\pi}{2^{N+2}}.
\end{equation}
%Suppose two stations diverge at generation $N$ and never meet after that. Then we can bound the distance between the endpoints from below. This is not quite as trivial as it sounds but it is correct.

Combining the previous estimates gives
\begin{align*}
	\Length\left(\eta_{\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}}\right) 
	\lesssim	\left|\zeta_{1}-\zeta_{2}\right|
\end{align*}
as desired.
\end{proof}



\section{Transporting the Rails} \label{rails-section}
Let $c\in\left[-\frac 34,\frac{1}{4}\right]$ and denote by $\psi$ the BÃ¶ttcher coordinate of $f: z\mapsto z^2+c$ at infinity. 
This means that $\psi$ is the unique conformal map $\D^{*}\to\mathrm{Exterior}(\mathcal{J})$  which fixes $\infty$ and satisfies the conjugacy $$f\circ\psi=\psi\circ f_{0}.$$
Since the Julia set $\mathcal J$ is a Jordan curve, the map $\psi$ extends to a homeomorphism between the circle $\partial\D$ and the Julia set $\mathcal{J}(f)$ by CarathÃ©odory's
theorem.

We apply $\psi$ to the rails that we constructed in $\mathbb D^*$ to obtain the corresponding rails in $\mathrm{Exterior}(\mathcal{J})$:
\begin{definition}

1. The 	\emph{stations} of $f_c$ are the points  $s_{n,k,c}=\psi(s_{n,k})$.

2. The \emph{$c$-tracks} are the curves of the form $\psi \left(\gamma_{s,s'}\right)$, where $\gamma_{s,s'}$ is a track. They are classified as express or peripheral according to the corresponding classification of $\gamma_{s,s'}$. 

Express tracks lie on \emph{external} rays of the filled Julia set $\mathcal K$.
Peripheral tracks lie on the level sets of $\psi$, or equivalently on the \emph{equipotentials} of $\mathcal K$.

3. Let $z_1,z_2\in \mathcal J$ and let $\zeta_i=\psi^{-1}(z_i)$ be the corresponding points on $\partial \mathbb D^*$. 
The \emph{$c$-itineraries} are $\eta_{z,z'}=\psi(\eta_{\zeta,\zeta'})$.

We omit $c$ from the notation for ease of reading. It will be clear from the context whether we work in $\mathbb D^*$ or in $\mathrm{Exterior}(\mathcal J)$.

%These itineraries can equivalently be obtained directly as in the case of $\mathbb D^*$, in terms of following the central itineraries from the common ancestor in the tree structure.
%Trivially since $\psi$ is a bijective correspondence between the two decompositions.
\end{definition}

Note that $\psi\left((1,\infty)\right)\subseteq\R$ since $\mathcal{J}$ is symmetric with respect to the real line. In particular $\psi(s_{0,0})\in\R$, i.e.\ the $c$-central station is real.

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
Formally, $\overline{\psi}(\overline{z})$
	is another conformal conjugacy between $f$ and $f_0$ which fixes infinity, so by uniqueness of the BÃ¶ttcher coordinate we obtain $\psi(z)=\overline{\psi}(\overline{z})$,
	hence $\psi(z)\in\R$ for $z\in\R$.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\section{Hyperbolic Maps}

A rational map is \emph{hyperbolic} if every critical point converges to an attracting cycle.
Hyperbolic maps enjoy the principle of the conformal elevator, which roughly says that any ball centered on the Julia set can be blown up to a definite size. More precisely, we have the following:

\begin{proposition}[The Principle of the Conformal Elevator] \label{elevator}
	Let $f$ be a rational hyperbolic map, let $z\in \mathcal J$ be a point on the Julia set of $f$ and let $r>0$. Then there exists some forward iterate $f^{\circ n}$ of $f$ which is injective on the ball $B(z,2r)$ and such that
	$\diam {f^{\circ n}(B(z,r))}$ is bounded below uniformly in $z$ and $r$. 
\end{proposition}

%See \cite{bonk_quasisymmetries_2016} for a stronger version, details and a proof.

\begin{corollary} \label{elevator for points on julia}
	Let $f$ be a rational hyperbolic map. There exists  $\epsilon$ such that for every two points $z,w\in\mathcal{J}(f)$, there is a forward iterate
$f^{\circ n}$ for which $\left|f^{\circ n}(z)-f^{\circ n}(w)\right|>\epsilon$.	
\end{corollary}

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
	Apply \cref{elevator} to a ball centered on the Julia set which contains $z,w$ on its boundary at roughly antipodal points. After blowing up we get points $f^{\circ n}(z),f^{\circ n}(w)$ which are a definite distance apart by Koebe's distortion theorem. %\todo{make this correct}
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

We are now ready to show the analogue of \cref{quasiconvex disk}:
%\todo{We use more than hyperbolicity, also that the Julia set is a Jordan domain}
\begin{theorem} 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont(\roman*)]

\item Let $z\in\mathcal{J}$ and decompose its central itinerary into tracks, 
\begin{equation*}
\eta_z = \gamma _1 +\gamma_2 +\ldots.
\end{equation*}
Then we have the estimate
\begin{equation*}
\Length(\gamma_{k})\lesssim\theta^{-k}
\end{equation*}
uniformly in
$z$, for some constant $\theta=\theta(c)>1$.

\item The domain $\mathrm{Exterior}(\mathcal{J})$ is quasiconvex with the itineraries $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ as certificates.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont(\roman*)]
\item The map $f$ has some iterate $f^{\circ N}$ such that $|f^{\circ N}|>1$ on the Julia set $\mathcal{J}$, where $N$ is independent of $z$.
By the compactness of $\mathcal J$, there is some $\theta >1 $ uniform in $z$ such that $\left|(f^{\circ N})'\right|>\theta$ on some neighborhood $\mathcal{U}$ of $\mathcal{J}$.
Every itinerary is eventually contained in $\mathcal{U}$, so for almost all itineraries $\gamma$ we have 
\begin{equation*}
\Length ( f^{\circ N}(\gamma) ) \geq \theta \cdot \Length( \gamma). 
\end{equation*}

For every value $k$ modulo $N$, the peripheral tracks on circles $C_n$ of index $n \equiv k$ modulo N have a total length bounded by a geometric series of rate $\theta$, hence finite. 
The lengths of the express tracks can be bounded in the same way. % We conclude that the total length of the itinerary is bounded.

\item Since we already know that the lengths of tracks in the itinerary decay exponentially with rate $\theta>1$, the same proof of the case $c=0$ also shows quasiconvexity in this case.

We give a second proof, relying on \cref{elevator for points on julia}. This proof will better prepare us for the
parabolic $c=1/4$ case, in which we don't have expansion of $f$ on its Julia set.

By \cref{elevator for points on julia}, there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that any two points are $\epsilon$-apart under some iterate $f$. 
Let $z_{1},z_{2}\in\mathcal{J}(f)$. If $\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|\geq\epsilon$ then there is nothing to
prove since we may just concatenate $\eta_{z_{1}}$ and $\eta_{z_{2}}$
and absorb this bounded length into the quasiconvexity constant
$A$. 
\begin{comment}
Explicitly, if $\Length\left(\eta_{z}\right)\leq L$
for all $z\in\mathcal{J}$ then we take $A\geq\frac{2L}{\epsilon}$
and then automatically $\Length\left(\eta_{z_{1}}+\eta_{z_{2}}\right)\leq A\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|$.
\end{comment}

On the other hand, if $\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|<\epsilon$, then
we use  \cref{elevator for points on julia} to find an iterate $f^{\circ n}$ such that 
\begin{equation}
	|w_1-w_2|:=\left|f^{\circ n}(z_{1})-f^{\circ n}(z_{2})\right|\geq\epsilon.
\end{equation}
There is a certificate $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$
between them and we take the certificate $\eta_{z_{1},z_{2}}$ between the original points to be the component of $f^{\circ-n}\left(\eta_{w_1,w_2}\right)$
that connects the points $z_{1},z_{2}$. Now, by a distortion estimate
\begin{equation*}
\Length\left(\eta_{z_{0},z_{1}}\right)\asymp\frac{\Length\left(\eta_{w_0,w_1}\right)}{\left|\left(f^{\circ n}\right)'\left(\zeta\right)\right|}
\end{equation*}
 for some point $\zeta \in \mathcal{J}$. The denominator grows
with $n$ exponentially at rate $\theta$, while the numerator has
a bound of the form 
\[
\Length\left(\eta_{w_1,w_2}\right)\lesssim\left|w_1-w_2\right|\lesssim\theta^{n}\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|.
\]
Altogether 
\[
\Length\left(\eta_{z_{1},z_{2}}\right)\lesssim\frac{\theta^{n}\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|}{\theta^{n}}=\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|
\]
 so $\eta_{z_{1},z_{2}}$ is a quasiconvexity certificate.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section{The Cauliflower}
In this section $c=\frac 14$, so $f=f_{1/4}: z\mapsto z^2+ \frac 14$ etc.

The cauliflower has cusps at the landing points of the dyadic external rays, i.e. the points whose central itinerary has only finitely-many peripheral tracks.
% We use  the same certificates as in the hyperbolic case, but now it is trickier to show that they work.

We prove the following:
\begin{theorem} \label{quasiconvex-cauliflower}
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont(\roman*)]
	\item Let $\zeta\in\partial{\D^*}$ and $z=\psi(\zeta)$. Then 
%	\begin{equation}
$	\Length(\eta_z)<\infty.$
%	\end{equation}

     \item The domain $\mathrm{Exterior}(\mathcal{J})$ is quasiconvex with the itineraries $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ as certificates.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\iffalse
Quantitatively, %let $\zeta=\psi^{-1}(z)\in\partial{D}$ and decomp
decompose the central itinerary into its constituent tracks $\eta_z = \gamma _1 +\gamma_2 +\ldots,$
then we have the bound $$
and decompose its central itinerary into tracks, 
$$\eta_\zeta = \gamma _1 +\gamma_2 +\ldots.$$
Then
$$\Length(\psi(\gamma_{k}))\lesssim\theta^{-k}$$ uniformly in
$\zeta$, for some constant $\theta=\theta(c)>1$.	
\fi

To prove \cref{quasiconvex-cauliflower} we develop some machinery. We decompose the points of the circle according to the first \emph{departure}\,: the first time that the central itinerary made a turn.

\input{"marker path 3.tex"}

\begin{definition}
Let $n \in \mathbb N$. We define the $n$-th \emph{departure set} $I_n \subset \partial \mathbb D ^*$ to be the set of points $\zeta \in \partial \mathbb D^*$ whose central itinerary $\eta_{\zeta}$ starts with $n$ express tracks, followed by a peripheral track.
See \cref{fig:departure-decomposition}.
\end{definition}

This departure decomposition is invariant under $f_0$ in the sense that $f_0(I_{n+1})=I_n$, because of the invariance of $\eta _\zeta$.
Thus by applying the BÃ¶ttcher map $\psi$ we obtain a corresponding departure decomposition of $\mathcal J$ that is invariant under $f$.

\subsection{Building the Elevator}

The map $f$ has a parabolic fixed point at $\frac 12$, so the usual conformal elevator does not apply. We now develop a substitute.

\begin{theorem}[Parabolic Conformal Elevator on $\mathcal J$] \label{parabolic-elevator}
	Let $d\geq 2$ be an integer. Every pair of points $z_1,z_2 \in \mathcal J$ has a forward iterate $f^{\circ N}$ satisfying at least one of the following two conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont(\roman*)]
		\item $\left|f^{\circ N}(z_1)-f^{\circ N}(z_2)\right|>\epsilon$, where $\epsilon=\epsilon(d)>0$ is a constant;
		
		or
		\item $f^{\circ N }(z_1) \in \psi(I_n)$ and $f^{\circ N }(z_2) \in \psi(I_m)$ with $|m-n| \geq d$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\iffalse
\begin{proof}
Let
\begin{align*}
\CriticalOrbit(f)=\{f^n(0): n \in \mathbb N\}
\end{align*} be the forward orbit of the critical point.
As long as the distance $|z_1-z_2|$ is small in comparison to the distances of $z_1,z_2$ from $\CriticalOrbit(f)$, we profit from applying $f$: By standard distortion estimates, 
\begin{align*}
|f(z_1)-f(z_2)|\geq c |z_1-z_2|
\end{align*}
for some constant $c>1$.

Indeed, in this case there is an annulus of definite modulus that has both $z_1,z_2$ in its bounded complementary component and has all points of $\CriticalOrbit(f)$ in the unbounded complementary component.

Instead of keeping track of the distance to $\mathrm{CriticalOrbit}(f)$, it is enough to consider the distance to the fixed point $1/2$, which is its only accumulation point on $\mathcal J$.

Thus by repeatedly applying $f$ we either manage to separate $z_1,z_2$ a definite distance apart, in which case the argument for the hyperbolic case works, or we manage to make (WLOG) 
\begin{align*}
\big|f^{\circ m} (z_1)-\tfrac 12\big| \leq c |f^{\circ m} (z_1)-f^{\circ m} (z_2)|
\end{align*}
for a constant $c$.
\end{proof}
\fi

\subsection{Climbing the Elevator}
%\cref{parabolic-elevator} reduces \cref{quasiconvex-cauliflower} to the case when $f^{\circ N }(z_1) \in \psi(I_n)$ and $f^{\circ N}(z_2) \in \psi(I_m)$ with $|m-n| \geq d$.

The following lemma shows that to check quasiconvexity it is enough to connect points after replacing them with a forward-image of our choice.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem1}
Let $z_1,z_2 \in \mathcal J$, and suppose that for some forward iterates 
$$w_1=f^{\circ N }(z_1),\quad w_2=f^{\circ N }(z_2)$$
the itinerary $\eta_{w_1,w_2}$ satisfies 
\begin{equation*}
	\Length(\eta_{w_1,w_2}) \leq A |w_1-w_2|.
\end{equation*}
Then the original points enjoy a similar estimate,
\begin{equation*}
	\Length(\eta_{z_1,z_2}) \leq B |z_1-z_2|
\end{equation*}
where $B$ depends only on $A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Koebe's distortion theorem,
\begin{equation*}
	|w_1-w_2| \asymp |z_1-z_2| \cdot |(f^{\circ n})'|
\end{equation*}
and likewise
\begin{align*}
\Length (\eta_{w_1,w_2}) \geq \Length(f^{\circ n}(\eta_{z_1,z_2})) \\
 \asymp \Length(\eta_{z_1,z_2}) \cdot |(f^{\circ n})'|
\end{align*}

\end{proof}

By \cref{lem1} and \cref{parabolic-elevator}, it is enough to show that the itinerary $\eta_{z_1,z_2}$ is a certificate for points that satisfy
\begin{align} \label{parabolic separation}
	z_1 \in \psi(I_n), \quad z_2 \in \psi(I_m), \quad m-n \geq d.
\end{align}
where $d$ is a large enough integer.

Condition \eqref{parabolic separation} gives us some control from below on $|z_1-z_2|$.
Our next step is to control the length of the itinerary $\psi(\eta)=\psi(\eta_{z_1,z_2})$ from above.

 \input{"departure-decomposition.tex"}

We represent $\eta$ as a concatenation of three paths: the radial segment $\gamma_{m,n}=[s_{m,0},s_{n,0}]$ and the two other components, $\gamma _m$ and $\gamma_n$. See \cref{fig:Three-parts-of-eta}.
Thus we have
\begin{equation}
	\Length(\psi(\eta))=\Length(\psi(\gamma_m))+\Length(\psi(\gamma_{m,n}))+\Length(\psi(\gamma_n)).
\end{equation}

%Our goal is to show 
%\begin{equation} \label{quasiconvexity goal}
%\Length(\psi(\eta)) \lesssim |z_1-z_2|.
%\end{equation}

Notice that $\psi(\gamma _{m,n})$ is a line segment. To estimate its length, denote 
$\ell_k = \psi(s_{k,0})-\psi(s_{k+1,0}).$
In terms of $\ell _k$, we can write
\begin{equation*}
\Length(\psi(\gamma_{m,n})) = \ell_m+\ldots+\ell_n.
\end{equation*}

\begin{lemma} The lengths ${\ell_n}$ satisfy
	\begin{equation}
\frac{\ell_n}{\ell_{n+1}} \asymp 1.
	\end{equation}
	 In particular, for every constant $C$ there is some large enough integer $d$ such that
	\begin{equation*}
		\ell_{m+1}+\ldots+\ell_{n-1} \geq C (\ell_m+\ell_n)
	\end{equation*}
whenever $|m-n| \geq d$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
These segments are successive images under $f$ that accumulate at the cusp, so $\ell_n \asymp \frac 1n$. This proves the lemma. However, we give an alternative, more general argument.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\begin{equation*}
	\operatorname{InnerDiameter}(\psi(I_n)) \lesssim \ell_n
	\end{equation*}
	where the hidden constant is independent of $n$.
\end{lemma}

The condition $|m-n| \geq d$ prevents the segment $\gamma _{m,n}$ from being too small in comparison to the other two paths:
\begin{proposition} For $d \gg 1$, 
\begin{equation}
			\Length(\psi(\gamma_m)) \lesssim \Length(\psi(\gamma_{m,n})).
		\end{equation}
\end{proposition}



\begin{proposition} For $d \gg 1$, 
\begin{equation}
	\Length(\psi(\gamma_{m,n})) \lesssim |z_1-z_2|.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

%This concludes the proof.

\subsubsection*{Diameter Comparisons}

Denote by $\diam\left(A\right)$ the Euclidean diameter of a set $A$,
and by $i.\diam\left(A\right)$ the inner diameter on the escaping
set, i.e.\ the diameter induced by the Riemann mapping from the escaping
set to the disk.

\textbf{Claim. }$\diam T_{p,n}\asymp i.\diam T_{p,n}$.

\textbf{Claim. }$\diam U_{p,n}\asymp i.\diam U_{p,n}$.

\textbf{Observation. }Let $R>0$ be the distance from the post-critical
set to the Julia set. Consider the ball $B=B(z,\frac{R}{2})$.

Since $B$ is disjoint from the post-critical set, none of its preimages
$f^{-n}\left(B\right)$ contains the critical point $0$.

Thus $f$ restricted on each such preimage is univalent and 2-to-1.

By Koebe's distortion Theorem, applied to iterates $f^{\circ n}$,
the diameter of the preimages of $B$ changes by at most a multiplicative
constant.

This principle shows that all points $z$ on the Julia set $J(p_{c})$
are accessible, since after repeated applications of $f^{n}(B)$ we
get a topological ball of definite size which we may use to construct
an explicit path exiting $K$ in a rectifiable way.

\section{Accessibility in the Parabolic Case}

The basic strategy will be to investigate the geometry near the main
cusp $p=\frac{1}{4}$, since all other cusps are preimages of $p$
under $f$,

whence the principle of the conformal elevator reduces the general
case to the case of a point sufficiently close to the main cusp $p$.

To implement this strategy, we take some arbitrary other point on
the Julia set, connect it by a curve $\gamma$ to $a$, then consider
all preimages of $\gamma$.

In general, consecutive images near a parabolic point have consecutive
distances comparable to $\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ , where $n$ is the index
of the preimage.
