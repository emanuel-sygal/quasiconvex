1. When deducing quasiconvexity of the new itineraries, I need $f^{\circ n}$ to be univalent for the distortion argument.

2. If $c \in \heartsuit$ then $\mathcal J_c$ is a quasicircle.

3. If $c$ is on the boundary, $\mathcal J$ is still a Jordan curve.

4. Does 4.2 follow directly from the hyperbolic derivative estimate?

5. Does anything go wrong if I always move counterclockwise, instead of the shortest angular turn?

6. Rewrite the infinite product in a convergent way without resorting to conjugating by $1/z$?

7. How does the distortion argument work, exactly? Why is there such a neighborhood with definite modulus?

8. Suppose $f(z)$ is defined on the unit circle and its derivative is $|f'| \geq 2$...
