1. Can we just argue by some continuity without doing anything? The set of pairs lives inside a compact 
region $J \times J$, thus if the ratio len(eta)/len(segment) is somewhat continuous we are done.


2. If $c \in \heartsuit$ then $\mathcal J_c$ is a quasicircle.

3. If $c$ is on the boundary, $\mathcal J$ is still a Jordan curve.

5. Going always counterclockwise instead of the shortest angular turn

6. Rewrite the infinite product in a convergent way without resorting to conjugating by $1/z$

7. Make the distortion argument work, exactly? Why is there such a neighborhood with definite modulus?
